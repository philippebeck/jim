# Overview

Jim is a JavaScript micro-library that uses events for interactivity.

Jim offers a keyboard management system to associate a key with a parameterizable action.

It is therefore possible to access a specific page, whether on site or on the web, or to launch animations or actions; for example, give the user the possibility to disconnect by pressing the "Q" key ...

Jim is provided without any lines of jQuery code, nor any dependencies ...

Jim is still in its infancy, he will grow in the near future ...
